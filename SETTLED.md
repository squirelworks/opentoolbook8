# Settled

Logic Families is `9e954d01.tbk`. The filenames and calls below are the ones that book names.

## Filenames

- `93954302.tbk`
- `93954d01.tbk`
- `minstb32.dll`
- `nc81base.sbk`
- `nc81recs.sbk`
- `nc81test.sbk`
- `nc81trnr.sbk`
- `nida81.tbk`
- `tb80anm.sbk`
- `tb80r.sbk`

## Calls

`initializebase`, `initializerecs`, `initializetest`, and `initializetrnr` are the four `nc81*.sbk` books.

- `initializebase` is `nc81base.sbk`
- `initializerecs` is `nc81recs.sbk`
- `initializetest` is `nc81test.sbk`
- `initializetrnr` is `nc81trnr.sbk`

The other four calls are `nida81.tbk`.

- `enterapplication` is `nida81.tbk`
- `entersystem` is `nida81.tbk`
- `gotopagelist` is `nida81.tbk`
- `opensession` is `nida81.tbk`

## Resolve on open

On open, those filenames are looked up in this order: the book's directory, `--home`, `--home/courses`, then `--home/Nida98/Lessons`. The match ignores case. The report prints the path that was found. The book still opens when `minstb32.dll`, `93954302.tbk`, or `93954d01.tbk` is absent.

## Missing files are reported, not fatal

Logic Families names `minstb32.dll`. That file is not in the install list. Opening the book reports `named, not shipped` and still returns the book. A name that is in the install list but absent is `not found`. A starred install-list entry that is absent is `listed, not shipped`. None of the three stops the open.
